## Usage
To use the FAQ accordion, follow these steps:

1. Include the HTML markup for the accordion in your HTML file.
2. Link the provided JavaScript file (fqa.js) in your HTML file.
3. Customize the content of the accordion by modifying the HTML markup within the <div class="accordion"> element.
4. Save and open your HTML file in a web browser.

## How it Works
The JavaScript code in fqa.js adds event listeners to each question container. When a question container is clicked, the code toggles the active class on that container. This class is responsible for expanding and collapsing the associated answer.
