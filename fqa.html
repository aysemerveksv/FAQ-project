        <div class="questions">Should Electric Cars Be Charged Every Day?</div>
        <div class="answers">There is one question that new and prospective owners of electric vehicles frequently have: should electric cars be charged every day? 
            The answer to this issue varies depending on one's circumstances and choices. The answer to this one question, 
            "Should I charge my EV every day?" actually just comes down to how often you travel and how much range your vehicle has. If your car has a 200-mile range and you average more than 100 miles daily,
             you'll want to plug it in and charge it daily. </div>
        <div class="questions">When Should I Charge My Electric Car?</div>
        <div class="answers">The first answer to this question is that due to the different battery types and 
            sizes of electric vehicles, the charging times and durations are also different from each other. 
            The brand, model, and battery type of your vehicle are important factors here; therefore, drivers usually take
            care to charge their vehicles by taking breaks, especially during long journeys. If you use your vehicle every
            day, it is essential to charge it during the day so that you do not encounter any problems during the journey.
            In short, we can say that a fully charged EV is quite necessary before the trip. </div>
